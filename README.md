# **Investment Account Calculator**

This project involves the development of a program that calculates the
future value of an investment account over a specified number of years. 
The program allows users to input parameters such as initial investment amount,
monthly deposit amount, annual interest rate, and the number of years. 
It then computes and displays the ending balance and interest earned for each year,
both with and without additional monthly deposits.

## **Strengths:**

- Modular design promoting code reusability and scalability.
- Input validation preventing the acceptance of invalid inputs.
- Clear output formatting enhances user experience and understanding of results.

## **Areas for Enhancement:**
- Implementation of more robust error handling to gracefully manage unexpected scenarios.
- Addition of more comments to clarify complex logic or algorithms for better code comprehension.

## **Challenges Faced:**
- Determining the correct logic for calculating interest earned over multiple years accurately.
- Ensuring consistent and accurate output formatting for easy interpretation by users.

## **Transferable Skills:**
- Knowledge in object-oriented programming for designing and implementing modular and reusable code.
- Understanding of input validation techniques for developing robust software applications.
- Skills in algorithm design, particularly for financial calculations, which can be applied to various other projects.

## **Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability:**
- Meaningful variable names and consistent formatting improving code readability and maintainability.
- Encapsulation of related functionality within classes making easier modification and extension of the program.
- Input validation ensuring the program can handle diverse inputs without crashing.
- Modular design allowing easier maintenance and future enhancements by isolating specific functionalities within separate classes and methods.
